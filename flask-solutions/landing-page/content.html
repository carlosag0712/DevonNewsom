 Create a flask project capable of handling the following routes.<strong></strong></p><h3>localhost:5000/&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3><p>This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a greeting. This will be considered our 'root route'.</p><h3>localhost:5000/ninjas&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3><p>This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display information about ninjas.</p><h3>localhost:5000/dojos/new&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</h3><p>This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form. Don't worry where the form should be sent to for now, you can simply set your action blank, like this:<code>action=''</code>.</p><h3>Next Steps</h3><p>
 Create a folder inside of your project labeled <strong>static. </strong>This static folder will be used to serve all of our static content, such as&nbsp;stylesheets, images, and&nbsp;javascript files!
