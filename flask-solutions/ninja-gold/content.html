<h2>Assignment: Ninja Gold</h2>
<p>Create a simple game to test your understanding of flask, and implement the functionality below.</p>
<p>
 For this assignment, you're going to create a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or LOSE up to 50 golds. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.</p>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Refer to the wireframe below.</li>
 <li>Have the four forms appear when the user goes to http://localhost:5000.</li>
 <li>For the farm, your form would look something like
<pre data-language="html">&lt;form action="/process_money" method="post"&gt;
  &lt;input type="hidden" name="building" value="farm" /&gt;
  &lt;input type="submit" value="Find Gold!"/&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</pre>
In other words, you want to include a hidden value in the form and have each form submit the form information to /process_money.</li>
 <li>Have&nbsp;<strong>/process_money</strong>&nbsp;determine how much gold the user should have.</li>
 <li>You should only have <strong>2 routes</strong>&nbsp;-- '/' and '/process_money' (reset can be another route if you implement this feature).</li>
</ol>

<p>
 Please make sure that...
</p>
<ol>
 <li>when you visit, "localhost:5000/" you are seeing the page we described above (in other words, we don't want to have to go to "/gold/index" or other URL to see this app).</li>
 <li>the forms are sent to "/process_money" and not any other URL.</li>
 <li>the activities are stored in the&nbsp;session.&nbsp;No need to store anything in the database.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
